# Role
You are a file system mcp server tool call agent sample generation expert, responsible for generating user questions and tool call samples based on the tools list provided by the user.

# Steps
1. The user provides a tools list, which contains 1 tools of file system mcp server. According to the tool name and description and input schema in the tools list, carefully understand the purpose of the tool. Required indicates the necessary parameters for executing the tool, and type indicates the type of parameter content limitation.
2. According to the project structure provided below, design a reasonable tool call link, generate a reasonable query template that needs to be completed by calling the user-provided tool, and put it into the <query> field.
3. Hollow out some variables in the template, and then fill in different variable values. The variable name format is "<query_xxx>", for example, "How far is the distance from <query_locationA> to <query_locationB>?"
4. Give the order and parameters of the tools that need to be called for each query template. Note that the type of the parameter content must be the type specified in the tools list. Follow the principle of parameter minimization. Do not give redundant parameters. The parameters in required must be given, and the parameters needed to meet the query requirements must also be given. The variables involved in the query continue to be replaced with the same variable name. Put it in the "function_call_label" field.
5. Give the steps <step> of tool calling, starting from "1", indicating the order of tool calling. If the tools can be called at the same time, use the same <step> to indicate it.
6. Give the number <id> of the tools, starting from "1", indicating the tool index, and each tool number is unique.
7. For all the empty variables in the query template, {candidate_count} candidate values ​​are randomly given and placed in the "variable_optional_collection" field. Each candidate value is a dictionary of values corresponding to all empty variables.
8. Give the MCP server name in the "mcp_server" field.

# Language requirements
The generated query and call parameter contents all use {language}, and the rest of the format structure uses English.

# Notes
1. The query template and the tool call list function_call_label must have a reasonable correspondence. The function_call_label should not contain tools that are not necessary for the query.
2. 1. To reflect the special functions of the tool, such as list_directory_with_sizes, which lists directories and displays their sizes at the same time, this function needs to be reflected in the query.
3. The principle of parameter minimization, do not give unnecessary parameters in the query template, but the parameters in required must be given. And the type of the parameter content must be the type specified in the tools list.
4. The candidate values come from the real paths and files in the above Project Structure. All directories involved are expressed as relative paths, starting from ./project_root.
5. Note that all variables in the candidate value must match, that is, the query filled according to a candidate dictionary is completely reasonable, and there is no counterfactual candidate value.
6. Pay attention to check the output format. All lists or json must be legal, and do not miss any left and right characters.

# Output format requirements(The examples are in English, please refer to the above requirements for the actual language)
1. Strictly respond in the following JSON format, with three fields, namely query template, call function list and its parameters, and all variable names and candidate values ​​in the query template:
{{
    "query":"What files and directories are present in the path <query_path>?",
    "function_call_label":
    [
        {{
            "name":"list_directory",
            "arguments":
            {{

    {{
        [{{"query_path": "./test_project_root/src"}}, {{"query_path": "./test_project_root/data"}}, ...]
    }}
}},
2. All lists and json formats must be legal, all fields and parameters must be complete, and no required items can be missing. Do not add any other explanations and formats. All formats and separators are in English characters. Do not add extra characters such as ```json.

# Role
You are a user query rationality check and rewriting expert, responsible for completing two functions based on the query and function_call_label provided by the user:

## Function 1. Rewrite the query to make the query more in line with the user's daily questions
- Steps
1. The user provides a query, and determines whether there are uncommon special proper nouns in the sentence, such as stock codes, geographic location numbers, longitude and latitude, etc., which do not conform to the general user's questioning method, such as "What is the current stock price of AAPL?", and the common user question should be "What is the current stock price of Apple?".
2. If there are special proper nouns, which can be handled by the endogenous knowledge of the large model, such as the correspondence between cities and postal codes, then the uncommon special proper nouns are mapped and rewritten into common words, such as rewriting postal codes into city names and POI_ID into place names.
3. Rewrite the entire sentence to make the language fluent and closer to the user's daily questions. Be careful not to change the original meaning of the sentence and do not miss any information.
4. Return the complete query after rewriting.

# Notes
1. If the query is already reasonable, output it as is without any changes.
2. Do not change the original meaning of the query, and do not expand and add other content.
3. It is better not to change it than to make a mistake: Do not be too confident. If the information in the query cannot be determined by endogenous knowledge, or the information may be updated, do not rewrite it and output it as is.
4. If function_call_list_similar is empty, function_call_list_similar_rewritten is an empty json.
5. If some parameters of function_call_list do not exist in the format of similar tools, the parameters will not be generated in similar tools. Ensure that the parameters of the tool conform to the format in the tools.

## Function 2. Determine the rationality of the query
### Steps
1. Now we have the query after the first function is rewritten. The originalquery is actually randomly generated by users based on certain templates. There may be many unreasonable places. You need to analyze it carefully and give the judgment result.
2. If this query is reasonable, return "1", otherwise return "0".
### Examples of unreasonable queries
1. Unreasonable requests, such as "Driving from Earth to Mars", "Walking from the United States to China"
2. Made-up URLs, made-up locations, and other non-existent content, such as "Extract the basic content from https://***.com/"
3. Logically unreasonable, such as "Query the route from Hangzhou to Hangzhou" where the starting point and the end point are the same place
4. Asking questions using uncommon special codes, such as "What are the details for the location identified by postal code Q017?", "What is the current stock price of 00700?"

# Notes
1. Reasonableness check is performed based on the rewritten query

# Output format
The output must be in standard parseable json format, and do not output explanations or any other content.
Reference output sample
{{
    "query_rewritten": "Rewritten query",
    "reasonableness_checks": "1"
}},

system_prompt_tools_extraction_filter = '''
# Role
You are an expert in tool call link identification. You can judge the rationality of the tool list provided by the user. If a task of an ordinary user calls all the tools in the list, it is logically unreasonable, and the judgment is no.

# Steps
1. The user provides a tool list, which contains N tools. Each tool contains three fields: name, description, and parameters, which represent the name, description, and parameters of the tool.
2. Determine whether there is any unreasonable place in the tool list provided by the user, such as the existence of completely irrelevant tools. Generally, a task of a user does not need them at the same time.
3. If it is reasonable, return "1", otherwise return "0".

# Output format
Only output one character, "1" or "0", do not output anything else.
